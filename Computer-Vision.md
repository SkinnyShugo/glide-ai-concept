# Computer Vision Integration:
  a. Image Recognition: With Computer Vision, Glide can enable image recognition capabilities. Users can upload images, and the app can automatically identify objects, text, or scenes within the images. This can be particularly useful in apps for e-commerce, inventory management, or any situation where visual data needs to be processed.
  b. Augmented Reality (AR): By integrating AR through Computer Vision, Glide apps can overlay digital information on the real-world view captured by a device's camera. This opens up possibilities for apps in interior design, virtual try-ons, educational tools, and entertainment experiences.
  c. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Glide apps can utilize OCR to extract text from images, making it easier to capture data from photos, documents, or receipts. This feature could be valuable in apps for expense tracking, document management, or language translation.
